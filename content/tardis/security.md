# TARDIS Security Features
Feel like locking the door isn't enough? No worries as if you go into your [**Console**](../../blocks/console) then hit **Settings** above the **Sonic Settings** you should see the **Security** button. Right-clicking the button takes you to this menu...

Here you can see when your TARDIS has been built, and you can change some Security settings.

## Leave Behind
When activating this feature any other guest that doesn't have a **TARDIS key** (that is linked to your TARDIS) should leave the person behind when taking off your TARDIS. This feature is inspired by the Doctor WHO episode "Blink"

## Hostile Alarms
When this feature has been activated any hostile mobs that entered the **TARDIS** triggers the **Cloister Bell** until you have manually turned it off

# Other Info
# How to activate Isomorphic Security (Protocol 19)
On the console, find "Protocol 19" and use a key linked to that TARDIS and click on the control. Once that's done, anyone that has a key that's linked to the current TARDIS can use the console, but anyone without cannot interact with it at all.
