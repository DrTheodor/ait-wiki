Chameleon exterior also known as adaptive box is a special kind of exterior category.

When activated, it turns into a tree/desert well/chorus plant/giant mushroom and etc depending on the biome.

Due to [the way it was implemented](../../../development/how-it-works/chameleon/) it has 2 qualities:
1. It's undetectable. You can't use F3, WAILA or X-ray mods to find a disguised TARDIS.
2. It's dynamic. It doesn't have any presets, therefore it finds the shape to take dynamically. Meaning it works with modded (& datapack) biomes.
