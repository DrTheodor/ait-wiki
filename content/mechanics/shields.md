## How do I use the shields?

The shields them self have 2 modes 
1. Invisible
*  Invisible shields block liquids from entering and block you from getting sucked out into the vortex if your doors are open
2. Visible ![Visible shields active](images/shields/shield.png)
 + The Visible ones block players under the companion loyalty level from entering your TARDIS,they also incinerate any sort of projectile and will push back any type of entity.

Once you activate the shields they start off by default as invisible.
